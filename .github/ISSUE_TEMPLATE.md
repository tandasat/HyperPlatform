It is hugely helpful and speeds up investigation of a bug check or a hang issue
if the following files are provided:
- a Debug build version of a compiled SYS file and a PDB file
- a full set of source code used to build the SYS file if it has been modified
- a log file (i.e., C:\Windows\HyperPlatform.log)
- a system crash dump file (i.e., C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP)

GitHub does not support attaching of any binary files into issues. You may use
any free file hosting services, however. Here are some of those services:
- OneDrive
- DropBox
- GoogleDrive
- Sendspace
- Mega.nz
